# Ideas for the frontend on how to display these metrics
3D (Cesium):
- trajectory


PANEL:
- energy released (megatons TNT) (compare with famous bombs like "little boy" ...)
- crater diameter & depth (final) (m)
- time for each blast ring to "travel" to the next
- people in each ring
- total deaths estimation
- atmospheric entry: 
  - the asteroid begins to break up at an altitude of h1 (m)
  - the asteroid reaches peak energy at h2 (m)
  - the asteroid airbursts at h3 (or surface impact) (m)

MAP (rings in order from top to bottom):
- crater (transient) (m)
- crater (final) (m)
- circle for each blast ring (provide relatable examples, like "windows shatter at this treshold"...):
  - severe structural damage (>=70kPa) (m)
  - heavy damage (35-70kPa) (m)
  - moderate damage (20-35kPa) (m)
  - light damage (10-20kPa) (m)
  - minor damage (3-10kPa) (m)

MISC:
- ability to toggle rings on/off


pls adjust, expand it
